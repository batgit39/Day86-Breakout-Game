# Day86-Breakout-Game
A Retro game recreated in python tkinter

For those who don't know it's a simple game where you have to keep a ball from touching the lower end of the screen with the help of a paddle which can move right or left. And the ball breaks bricks whenever it collides which gives you a point.

This is a simple version so this is bare minimum you can do in a breakout game.
